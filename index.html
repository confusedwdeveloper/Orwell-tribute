      <h3>writing career</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Orwell’s first major work was 'Down and Out in Paris and London' (1933). The book provided a brutal look at the lives of the working poor and of those living a transient existence.
        </li>
        <li>His next book 'Burmese Days' (1934) explored his overseas experiences in Burmese Days, which offered a dark look at British colonialism in Burma, then part of the country's Indian empire.
        </li>
        <li>In 1944 Orwell finished Animal Farm, a political fable based on the story of the Russian Revolution and its betrayal by Joseph Stalin.</li>
        <li>Animal Farm was one of Orwell’s finest works, full of wit and fantasy and admirably written. It has, however, been overshadowed by his last book, Nineteen Eighty-four (1949), a novel he wrote as a warning after years of brooding on the
          twin menaces of Nazism and Stalinism.
        </li>
        <li>Orwell spoke on many BBC and other broadcasts, but no recordings are known to survive
        </li>
        <li>To support himself, Orwell took on various writing assignments. He wrote numerous essays and reviews over the years, developing a reputation for producing well-crafted literary criticism.
        </li>
      </ul>
